<h3>Aim of meeting</h3>
<p> The aim of this meeting is to take a broad overview of the 
project so far, present, in techincal detail the work done so far and the
work planned for the final 22 months of the project.  The industrial
partners will describe the nature of their work as it relates to the
NaaS project.  The academic partners will describe their intended work
plan for the next stage of the project.  The aim is to ensure:
<ul>
<li>The work performed is relevant to real world needs.</li>
<li>Where possible the project benefits from the knowledge and
expertise of industrial partners.</li>
<li>Avenues for commercial exploitation of this work with the
existing industrial partners are fully explored.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Agenda in detail</h3>
<h4>NaaS project overview</h4>
<p>The broad aim of the NaaS project is to investigate in-network
line rate processing that can help data centres where their performance
is network bound.  In particular this involves several elements:
<ul>
<li>A on path application specific middlebox that can process application
data at line rate.</li>
<li>Offloading appropriate processing to fast dedicated hardware elements
such as the NetFPGA boards where appropriate.</li>
<li>Routing and filtering streams as appropriate using carefully
designed Software Defined Network (SDN) techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Progress to date: NetAgg box</h4>
<p>This is an implementation of the first stage of the NaaS vision,
an on-path middlebox that can speed up processing for Hadoop and Solr
at line rate.  This improves the processing power of these
technologies and reduces the burden they put on the data centre network.</p>
<h4>Mirage/OpenFlow</h4>
<p>OpenFlow is the best-known and most widely deployed SDN technology.
Work within the project has implemented a lightweight switch capable of
OpenFlow version 1.4 (the latest version at the time of writing) using
unikernels within the Mirage/Xen environment.  This allows the deployment
of an extremely lightweight software switch.</p>
<h4>Industrial Partner presentations</h4>
<p>Details to follow</p>
<h4>NaaS box: application specific middlebox</h4>
<p>
The project will generalise the NetAgg work to produce a middlebox
design that will allow a wide variety of middlebox tasks (both
traditional and novel) to be easily aided with in network processing.
A specifically designed high-level language will allow developers to 
simply code the middlebox task appropriately but will restrict the
capabilities to ensure that their designs can run at line rate in
a high-speed network environment (10G and above).
A brief description of the plans for this will be followed by a general
discussion about the best ways to proceed.
</p>
<h4>NetFPGA DMA for high-performance networking and acceleration</h4>
The goal of this project is to make use of NetFPGA for both NIC and 
general-purpose acceleration by means of high-performance/PCI-efficient
DMA engine. The entire hardware (DMA engine) and software (device driver)
are being developped from scratch and open-sourced for the current and 
next generation of NetFPGA boards. The new DMA/driver can be used for
high-performance packet processing and offloading of compute-intensive
application functions. This project expects its open implementation to help 
extend NetFPGA to accommodate various application-aware middlebox
functionality beyond NIC.
