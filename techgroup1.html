<h3>Aim of meeting</h3>
<p> The aim of this meeting is to take a broad overview of the 
project so far, present, in techincal detail the work done so far and the
work planned for the final 22 months of the project.  The industrial
partners will describe the nature of their work as it relates to the
NaaS project.  The academic partners will describe their intended work
plan for the next stage of the project.  The aim is to ensure:
<ul>
<li>The work performed is relevant to real world needs.</li>
<li>Where possible the project benefits from the knowledge and
expertise of industrial partners.</li>
<li>Avenues for commercial exploitation of this work with the
existing industrial partners are fully explored.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Agenda in detail</h3>
<h4>NaaS project overview (Peter Pietzuch)</h4>
<p>The broad aim of the NaaS project is to investigate in-network
line rate processing that can help data centres where their performance
is network bound.  In particular this involves several elements:
<ul>
<li>A on path application specific middlebox that can process application
data at line rate.</li>
<li>Offloading appropriate processing to fast dedicated hardware elements
such as the NetFPGA boards where appropriate.</li>
<li>Routing and filtering streams as appropriate using carefully
designed Software Defined Network (SDN) techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Progress to date: NetAgg box (Paolo Costa)</h4>
<p>This is an implementation of the first stage of the NaaS vision,
an on-path middlebox that can speed up processing for Hadoop and Solr
at line rate.  This improves the processing power of these
technologies and reduces the burden they put on the data centre network.</p>
<h4>Progress to date: Mirage/OpenFlow (Masoud Koleini)</h4>
<p>In this strand of work, the project has built an OpenFlow unikernel. 
Unikernels are small, type-safe, memory-safe application-specific virtual machines. 
Our OpenFlow unikernel supports both switch and controller functions, and is built in OCaml, 
a  memory-safe statically-typed language that's immune to certain classes of bug, using 
Mirage OS. Unikernels are both much smaller and (typically) faster than other virtual machines, 
e.g., with a memory footprint typically less than 7MB. These OpenFlow  unikernels will enable 
middleboxes with custom sophisticated switching and routing protocols to be managed by a 
logically centralised controller.  At the current time we have an operational OpenFlow 1.4
switch built as a unikernel using the Frenetic libraries.
</p>
<h4>Industrial Partner presentations: Netronome</h4>
<p>Netronome is providing products and solutions for accelerating flow-aware packet processing in commodity servers, targeted at vSwitch offload in end-server NICs and accelerating SDN enabled middleboxes. We'll present a quick overview over the products relevant to the NAAS project and highlight some challenges we see in these areas.</p>
<h4>Industrial Partner presentations: Xilinx</h4>
<p>Xilinx provides the FPGA that underpins the NetFPGA board.  This talk will overview research in Xilinx Labs that has led to the Xilinx SDNet product for doing packet processing at up to 100G rates, driven from a high-level specification.  It will also cover current SDN-related research, which includes integrating the control plane of SDNet into current Openflow and next-generation OpenFlow settings.  These topics have a close overlap with the NaaS project's aims.</p>
<h4>Industrial Partner presentations: Citrix</h4>
<p>We will summarize Citrix's product interest in software-defined networking and adjacent areas; this will focus on our server virtualization and IaaS cloud products, XenServer and CloudPlatform, but will also touch on our networking products including NetScaler. We will describe XenServer's current and desired future use of relevant technologies such the Open vSwitch and Mirage-based services. We will conclude by sharing our thoughts on the future of network services in a commoditized platform.</p>
<h4>Industrial Partner presentations: BT</h4>
<p>BT High Performance Cloud: Analytics as a Service:
We will outline the High Performance Cloud services that BT is building to extend our products for the Financial sector. The BT Radianz Cloud community is the world's largest secure networked financial community, consisting of many thousands of financial user locations around the globe. We will specifically focus on Analytics as a Service, as an example of a potential use-case for Open-Mirage. We will close with a summary of the forum BT initiated to standardise the execution environment of virtualised network functions.</p>
<h4>Industrial Partner presentations:</h4>
<p>More to follow<p>
<h4>NaaS box: application specific middlebox (Richard Clegg)</h4>
<p>
The project will generalise the NetAgg work to produce a middlebox
design that will allow a wide variety of middlebox tasks (both
traditional and novel) to be easily aided with in network processing.
A specifically designed high-level language will allow developers to 
simply code the middlebox task appropriately but will restrict the
capabilities to ensure that their designs can run at line rate in
a high-speed network environment (10G and above).
A brief description of the plans for this will be followed by a general
discussion about the best ways to proceed.
</p>
<h4>NetFPGA DMA for high-performance networking and acceleration</h4>
<p>
The goal of this project is to make use of NetFPGA for both NIC and 
general-purpose acceleration by means of high-performance/PCI-efficient
DMA engine. The entire hardware (DMA engine) and software (device driver)
are being developped from scratch and open-sourced for the current and 
next generation of NetFPGA boards. The new DMA/driver can be used for
high-performance packet processing and offloading of compute-intensive
application functions. This project expects its open implementation to help 
extend NetFPGA to accommodate various application-aware middlebox
functionality beyond NIC.
</p>

<h4>Mirage SDN switching and control</h4>
<p> After performance tuning our current implementation, our future plans include 
extending our OpenFlow  switch implementation to handle complex application-specific 
protocols and uses requiring features such as DPI and modification of packet payload 
data. We are also investigating use of more recent SDN frameworks than OpenFlow such as 
Protocol Oblivious Forwarding (POF) from Huawei.</p>
<h4>Progress summary and next steps</h4>
<p>
This wrap-up session will allow us to critique the progress so far and,
more importantly, decide on the next steps for the work.  What are 
the longer term goals?  Is the project proceeding in a realisitic way?
Can the goals of industrial partners be aided by changes to the work
plan?  How frequently should these technical group meetings occur?
